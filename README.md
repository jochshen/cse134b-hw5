#Part 3 Changes

1. I deleted the `Get in Touch` Contact Form since it was required for HW 4. However, I thought that it wouldn't necessarily be the best fit for my website. I think if a user really wanted to get in contact, they would press the email icon. I didn't want a chunk of the page dedicated for that. 
2. I added a section of technologies/languages I worked with. I think that while it was good to showcase the projects I did and provide links to some of them, as a recruiter, knowing what technologies this developer is experienced with would be helpful when it comes to recruiting. If my experiences aligns with the tech stack needs of the program, then having these icons would be helpful visuals.
