## Part 3 Changes  

In this update, I removed the **"Get in Touch"** contact form since it was originally required for HW 4 but didn’t fit well with my website's design. Instead, users can contact me through the email icon, making the form unnecessary. I also added a section highlighting the **technologies and languages** I’ve worked with, as this helps recruiters quickly assess my experience and how it aligns with their tech stack needs. I thought it'd be cool to add more visual features to my website so this section consists of cool SVGs I found of icons of these technologies and languages. Additionally, I fixed a navigation issue by adding `scroll-margin-top` to ensure section titles are visible when using the navbar. Before when you pressed on the nav, it would correctly go to the right section in the website but would omit the title since the sticky navbar was covering it. Finally, I introduced `enhanced.js` to enable **smooth scrolling**, making navigation feel more polished and user-friendly. Additionally, when users first log onto the website, there is a smooth animation fading in.
